# CrowdCheer
A crowd-supported application allows spectators to cheer for marathon runners.

Run the bash script to generate a new version of the iOS app for download. Alternatively, you can download the latest version by visiting bit.ly/deltacrowdcheer on your iOS device. 

To view the Xcode project, download an archive of the repo and open CrowdCheer.xcworkspace.
